              <ul>
              <li>4 cups masa harina</li>
              <li>3 cups chicken stock, warmed</li>
              <li>2 cups lard</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
              <li>2 red bell peppers, seeded and diced</li>
              <li>4 jalapenos, seeded and minced</li>
              <li>1 red onion, diced</li>
              <li>2 cups corn kernels, fresh</li>
              <li>1/2 cup cilantro, chopped</li>
              <li>kosher salt</li>
              <li>50 corn husks soaked in warm water</li>
              <li>6 corn husks soaked in warm water or butcher twine</li>

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <ol>
              <li>Put the masa harina in a large bowl and reconstitute by adding warm chicken stock. Beat with a wooden spoon until the dough is stiff, but smooth. Add a little more stock if necessary, but be sure to keep the mixture firm.</li>
              <li>In another large bowl, beat the lard with a mixer fitted with a paddle until it is very fluffy, about 3 minutes. Continue to beat at medium speed and add the masa a little at a time until well combined. The texture should be light and fluffy. To see if the mixture is blended well enough, drop a teaspoon of the dough into a glass of water. If it floats, it's mixed well. If not, keep beating. Set aside.</li>
              <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat and cook the bell peppers, jalapenos and onion for 4-5 minutes or until the mixture begins to soften. Add the corn and cilantro, season with salt and remove the pan from the heat. Gently fold the mixture into the prepared masa until well combined, being careful not to overwork. Choose several softened corn husks and tear into 72 thin strips. These will be used to tie the tamales.</li>
              <li>On a clean, dry surface, spread out 42 softened corn husks and spoon approximately 2-3 tablespoons of the prepared masa into the middle of each husk. Roll each tamale lengthwise, tightly, then twist at both ends, much like the wrapper of a Tootsie Roll. Securely tie each end with a strip of the corn husk or butcher twine. Set aside.</li>
              <li>Prepare a steamer or a pot with a steaming rack, cover and steam the prepared tamales for approximately 1 hour, or until they is firm to the touch. Remove and serve warm with your favourite filling, or let cool, wrapped well in place and freeze for future use.</li>

           <h1>Ingrediants</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil divided</li>
                <li>2 cups masa harina 232g</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups warm water up to 1 ¾ cups, until you have a moist pliable dough</li>
                <li>5 ounces whole milk mozzarella cheese shredded</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="dish col-md col-lg">
              <h1>Instructions</h1>
              <ol>
                <li>Combine 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1 cup warm water in a small bowl. (You'll dip your hands in this mixture to keep the pupusa dough from sticking to your hands as you form the cakes.) </li>
                <li>Line a medium tray with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Whisk together masa harina and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Slowly add warm water, stirring constantly, until all of the water is incorporated and dough is moist and pliable. (Start with 1 ½ cups warm water and add more as needed to reach your desired consistency.)</li>
                <li>Dip your hands in oil and warm water mixture to moisten your fingers and palms. Scoop out about ⅛ of the dough, a little larger than a golf ball. With your hands, roll into a ball then gently press back and forth between your palms, shaping the dough into a disc, 3 to 4-inches wide. Add a large pinch of shredded cheese to the center of the disc and gently press the sides up all the way around to seal. Use your palms to press the ball back into a disc about ½-inch thick and place on prepared tray. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining oil in a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook pupusas until cooked through and lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Serve hot with Curtido and desired toppings.</li>

                <li>Add onion, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, parsley, oregano, and black pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese melts. Stir in tomato sauce, water, green pepper, garlic, chili powder, and salt.</li>
